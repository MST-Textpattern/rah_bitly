h3(#list-of-features). List of features

* Automatically generate shortened links for articles using "Bitly":http://bit.ly service.
* Easy to set up, easy to use.

h3(#requirements). Requirements

p. Rah_bitly's minimum requirements:

* Textpattern CMS v4.4.1 or newer.
* PHP: "cURL":http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php library or "allow_url_fopen":http://php.net/manual/en/filesystem.configuration.php set to true.
* Installed web server with internet connection and outgoing HTTP connections allowed.
* "Bitly":http://bit.ly account.
* End user: a modern web browser with JavaScript support.

Most servers, including shared hosting spaces, should be able to run *rah_bitly* just fine as long as Textpattern v4.4.1 or newer is installed.

h3(#installation). Installation

p. The usual plugin installation method is used by rah_bitly.

# Download, and copy and paste the plugin code to the _Install plugin_ field found in your Textpattern installation's _Plugins_ interface (TXP / Admin / Plugins).
# Start the automated setup process by click _Upload_ button next to the field.
# After the initial setup is done, active the plugin. Look for rah_bitly in the list of plugins and click the row's _Active_ columns link to active the it.

p. Now all is done and the plugin has been installed.

h3(#configuring). Configuring

p. To start using rah_bitly you will first need to define your _Bitly login_,  _API key_ and the "custom field":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=custom_field you want to use to store the shortened link.

p. Setting the preferences is easy. You can find all you need in Textpattern's "Advanced Preferences":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Advanced_Preferences (TXP/Admin/Preferences/Admin), neatly organized under _Bitly integration_. Following preferences will be present.

p. *Bitly Login* is where your login id to "Bitly":http://bit.ly service would go.

p. *API key* is your API key. You can find your API key from your "Bitly":http://bit.ly account's settings panel.

p. *Store in custom field* is the custom field that will be used to store the shortened link. Note: if by change you don't see your new, just created (note: just created), custom field right away in the list, make sure to reload the page. That's caused by minor Textpattern core quirk, and the way preferences are updated and reloaded.

h3(#inner-workings). Generating links

p. Bitly links are generated for an article, when one of the couple conditions is met.

* When the article is published for the first time with _live_ or _sticky_ status.
* When URL title has been modified and the article is still in _live_ or _sticky_ state.
* When the custom field used to store the link is empty and article is saved with _live_ or _sticky_ status.

p. New short URL won't be generated when URL title hasn't been changed and the custom field isn't empty, or when article is saved with status other than _live_ or _sticky_.

p. All generated links will follow your Bitly accounts preferences, including your custom domain or Bitly's preferred domain.

p. If requesting a short link form Bitly fails due to connection error, or because Bitly's servers are temporarily unreachable, a new request is sent when the article is saved again. You will notice if the request has been successful if there is a shortened link in the custom field.

p. The link that the plugin will shorten is the article permanent link, the real location of the individual article page that Textpattern responds to. It's the same location as where the _View_ link points on the admin-side _Write_ and _Articles_ panes.

h3(#displaying-links). Displaying links

p. Due to the fact that a "custom field":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=custom_field is used to store the shortened links, it's pretty easy to display that link in your public-side page templates.

bc. <txp:if_custom_field name="short_url">
	<a href="<txp:custom_field name="short_url" />"><txp:custom_field name="short_url" /></a>
</txp:if_custom_field>

For example the above snippet would display shortened Bitly link when placed to "article form":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Forms or "context":http://textpattern.net/wiki/index.php?title=Textpattern:_Context_In_Depth. The @short_url@ is the name of the custom field.
